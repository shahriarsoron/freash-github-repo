At Khandaq, he famously killed the Quraysh warrior Amr ibn Abd Wudd in a duel. As the fourth Caliph, he faced the challenges of the First Fitna but maintained integrity, humility, and justice. He is revered by both Sunnis and Shias, and his wisdom is preserved in many Islamic texts.</li>

            <li><span class="ftft">Legacy</span>: Khalid embraced Islam after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. Though he once fought against Muslims in Uhud, he later became the Prophet’s most trusted general, earning the title “Saifullah” (Sword of Allah). He led the Muslim army through dozens of crucial battles during the Ridda Wars and the early conquests of Persia and the Levant, never once tasting defeat. His tactical genius, such as his maneuver at Walaja (double envelopment), is still studied in military academies.</li>

Despite his military victories, he is remembered just as strongly for his compassion and chivalry — offering medical care to wounded Crusaders and allowing peaceful Christian withdrawal from Jerusalem.</Li>
